# Comparison of different populations
This program supports the comparison of different population growth.
The application receives from the user the size (number of people) of 2
different populations (A, B) where population A is < than population B.
The request receives from the user the corresponding growth rates (%) of the same populations (A, B) where growth rate A > growth-rate B.
The application calculates and presents the number of years it takes for population A to exceed or equal the population of country B, maintaining growth rates.
I use a method called "YearsForecast" to perform the calculation.
